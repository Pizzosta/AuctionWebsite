auction = Auction.query.join(User).filter(User.is_admin == True, Auction.deleted == False).order_by(Auction.created_at.desc()).first()

retrieve only valid auction
auction = Auction.query.filter(Auction.deleted == False).order_by(Auction.created_at.desc())

work on

fix for the admin
Bid amount must be equal to or greater than the starting bid.

on validation float is 0.00 2 decimal places

you have to outbid the last bidder to appear on the top list(test it more)
